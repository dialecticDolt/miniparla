"""
This module implements graph/sparse matrix partitioning inspired by Gluon.
The goal of this module is to allow simple algorithms to be written against the current sequential implementation,
and eventually scale (without changes) to parallel or even distributed partitioning.
As such, many functions guarantee much less than they currently provide
(e.g., `~PartitioningAlgorithm.get_edge_master` is only guaranteed to see it's source and destination in `~PartitioningAlgorithm.vertex_masters` even though the initial sequential implementation will actually provide all masters.)

The partitioner uses two functions getVertexMaster and getEdgeMaster similar to those used by Gluon, but also provides access to vertex attributes like position.
The `~PartitioningAlgorithm.get_vertex_master` function selects the master based on vertex attributes or more typical graph properties.
The `~PartitioningAlgorithm.get_edge_master` function selects the master based on edge properties and the masters selected for the endpoints.

The partitioner also takes a `~PartitioningAlgorithm.neighborhood_size` parameter which specifies how far away from each vertex proxies are needed.
Edge proxies are included for all edges between vertices present on each node (either as master or as a proxy).

This module will work just like normal Gluon if neighborhood size is 1.
For vertex position based partitioning, we can just assign the node masters based on position and set an appropriate neighborhood.
For your sweeps algorithm, set neighborhood size to 2 and assign masters as needed.
