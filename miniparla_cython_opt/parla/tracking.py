#TODO(wlr): Nothing in this file is threadsafe at the moment. Developing structure first, then we'll add locks.

#TODO(wlr): I assume PArrays hash to a unique value during their lifetime. If not, we'll need to add such a hash function to PArray.

#TODO(wlr): This is developed without considering sliced PArrays.
# For slices, I imagine we might need something with the following rules:
#   - An access of a slice, locks the parent on that device
#   - An eviction of a slice, may not evict the parent
#   - An eviction of a parent, evicts all slices

# I'm less certain about the following:
#   - Updating the priority of a slice, updates the priority of the parent
#   - Updating the priority of a parent, updates the priority of all slices
